This policy describes:
This policy applies only to the information OGGY collects through its Services, in email, text and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with its Services.
This policy DOES NOT apply to information that you provide to, or that is collected by, any third-party, such as restaurants at which you make reservations and/or pay through Diaz Cartel’s Services and social networks that you use in connection with its Services. Diaz Cartel encourages you to consult directly with such third-parties about their privacy practices.

By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.
First things first – your privacy is important to us. That might be the kind of thing all these notices say, but we mean it. You place your trust in us by using Oggy.co.in services and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. We act in our customers’ best interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.
This document describes how we use and process your personal data, provided in a readable and transparent manner. It also tells you what rights you can exercise in relation to your personal data (such as the right to object) and how you can contact us. 
If you’ve used us before, you know that OGGY provides online ordering of services and offers best prices related to food services through our own websites and mobile apps, as well as other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social media. We’d like to point out that all the information you are about to read, generally applies to not one, not two, but all of these platforms. 
OGGY provides a single platform to compare aggregator offers through its Mobile Applications or its website (https://oggy.co.in/), Further OGGY has a right to use the publicly available data from the third party Sites for the purpose of listing their menu items or the Products for online ordering by the Customers on third-party sites.
The Customers can access the menu items or Products listed on the OGGY Platform and place online orders against the Restaurant Partner(s)/Store(s) through aggregator.
Offers may vary at the time of viewing due to third party data.
Delivery of an order placed by you through the OGGY Platform may either be undertaken directly by the Restaurant Partner or the Store against whom you have placed an order, or facilitated by OGGY through third-party who may be available to provide delivery services to you (“Delivery Partners”). In both these cases, OGGY is merely acting as an intermediary between you and the Delivery Partners, or you and the Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the case may be.
Customers may be charged a delivery fee for delivery of your order by the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store may determine (“Delivery Charges"). The Delivery Partner is authorized to collect, on behalf of the Restaurant Partner to charge the Delivery Charges for the delivery of the food service provided by the Restaurant Partner or the Store as the case may be. The Delivery Charges may vary from order to order, which may be determined on multiple factors which shall include but not be limited to Restaurant Partner / Store, order value, distance, time of the day. In fact, this single privacy statement applies to any kind of customer information we collect through all of the above platforms or by any other means connected to these platforms (such as when you contact our customer service team by email).
If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our Privacy Statement for Business Partners to understand how personal data is further processed as part of the business relationship.
We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time, so we recommend you visit this page occasionally to make sure you know where you stand. If we make any changes to the Privacy Statement that will have an impact on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes than previously communicated), we’ll notify you of these changes before the new activities begin.
And now, the sad but necessary bit: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue using our services. If you agree with our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to Order next time through us.

We use the information collected about you for a variety of purposes. Your personal data may be used in the following ways:
1.	Food Choices: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and deliver your foods at your door step location. This includes sending you food delivery instructions that relate to food specifications, such as confirmations, modifications and reminders.
2.	Customer Service: We provide international customer service from our local offices in more than 20 languages, and we’re here to help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our customer service staff allows us to respond when you need us. This includes helping you to contact the officer and responding to any questions you might have about food delivery order (or any other queries, for that matter).
3.	Account Facilities: Oggy.co.in users can create an account on our website or apps. We use the information you give us to administer this account, allowing you to do a number of useful things. You can manage your orders, take advantage of special offers, make future orders easily and manage your personal settings.
Managing personal settings gives you the ability to keep and share lists, share photos, easily see foods items you’ve searched for and check delivery instructions related information you’ve provided. You can also see any reviews you’ve written.
If you want to, you can share certain information as part of your user account, by creating a public profile under your own first name or a screen name you choose.
4.	Online Groups: It’s possible that we might give account holders the chance to connect and interact with each other through online groups or forums.
5.	Marketing Activities: We use your information for marketing activities. These activities include:
1.	Using your contact information to send you regular updates about food related offers. You can unsubscribe from email marketing communications quickly, easily and at any time. All you need to do is click on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link included in each newsletter or other communication.
2.	Based on your information, individualised offers might be shown to you on the Oggy.co.in website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites/apps (including social media sites) and the content of the site displayed to you might be personalised. These could be offers that you can book directly on the Oggy.co.in website, on co-branded sites, or other third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
6.	Communicating with you: There might be other times when we get in touch, including by email, by post, by phone or by texting you. Which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve previously shared.
7.	Market Research: We sometimes invite our customers to take part in market research. Please see the information that accompanies this kind of invitation to understand what personal data will be collected and how that data is used.
8.	Improving our Services: We also use personal data for analytical purposes and services improvement. This is part of our commitment to making our services better and enhancing the user experience.
In this case, we use data for testing and troubleshooting purposes, as well as to generate statistics about our business. The main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they are used, and ultimately to optimise and customise our website and apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use. As much as possible, we strive to use pseudonyms for this analytical work.
9)	Providing the best price applicable to you, depending on where you are based: When you search our apps or website, for example to find an accommodation, a rental car or a flight, we process your IP address to confirm whether you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in another country. We do this to offer you the best price for the region (EEA) or country (non-EEA) where you are based.

10)	Customer reviews and other destination-related information: During and after your order, we might invite you to submit a review. This invite asks for information about your delivery time taken by Delivery Partner who delivers your food at your door step.
If you have an Oggy.co.in account, you can choose to display a screen name next to your review, instead of your real name or even submit the review anonymously. If you’d like to set a screen name, you can do that in your account settings. Adding an avatar is also possible.
11)	Call monitoring: When you make calls to our customer service team, Oggy.co.in uses an automated telephone number detection system to match your telephone number to your existing orders. This can help save time for both you and our customer service staff. However, our customer service staff may still ask for authentication, which helps to keep your orders details confidential.
During calls with our customer service team, live listening might be carried out or calls might be recorded for quality control and training purposes. This includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of complaints, legal claims and for fraud detection.
Not all calls are recorded and recordings are kept for a limited amount of time before being automatically deleted. An exception to this rule would be if Oggy.co.in has a legitimate need to keep the recordings longer for fraud investigation or legal purposes.
12.	Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service: We might use personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.
Similarly, we might use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including the authentication of users and reservations. 
13.	Legal purposes: We may share your information when we believe in good faith that such sharing is reasonably necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities or to comply with legal process. We may also share your information to investigate and address threats or potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to investigate and address violations of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, or to investigate and address violations of the rights of third parties and/or to protect the rights, property and safety of OGGY, our employees, users, or the public. This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations on account of legal request such as subpoena, court order or government demand to comply with the law.

This may also include a copy of your food order payment or the IP address used to order the food. We may share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.

We share personal data with advertising partners, including your email address, as part of marketing Oggy.co.in services via third parties (to ensure that relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience).

For information on other personalised advertisements and your choices, please read our Cookie Statement.
o	Advertising partners
We use advertising partners, such as______________, to allow you to compare our offers with the offers of other Online Food Related Agencies.

4.	Competent authorities: We disclose personal data to law enforcement to the extent that it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud, or if we are otherwise legally obliged to do so. We may need to further disclose personal data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights and properties of our business partners.

Functional cookies
These are cookies required for our websites and apps to function and they must be enabled in order for you to use our services.
Functional cookies are used to create technologically advanced, user-friendly websites and apps that adapt automatically to your needs and preferences, so you can browse and book easily. This also includes enabling essential security and accessibility features.
More specifically, these cookies:

•	Remember your selected currency and language settings, your past searches and other preferences to help you use our website and apps efficiently and effectively.
•	Remember your registration information, so that you don’t have to retype your login credentials each time you visit our website or app. (Don’t worry, passwords will always be encrypted.)
Analytical cookies
These cookies measure and track how our website and apps are used. We use this information to improve our website, apps and services.
More specifically, these cookies:
•	Help us understand how visitors and customers like you use Oggy.co.in and our apps.
•	Help improve our website, apps, and communications to make sure we're interesting and relevant.
•	Allow us to find out what works and what doesn't on our website and apps.
•	Help us understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications.
•	Teach us how users interact with our website or apps after they have been shown an online advertisement, including advertisements on third-party websites.

The data we gather through these cookies can include which web pages you have viewed, which referring/exit pages you have entered and left from, which platform type you have used, which emails you have opened and acted upon, and date and time stamp information. It also means we can use details about how you’ve interacted with the site or app, such as the number of clicks you make on a given screen, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you enter into various fields.
Marketing cookies
These cookies are used by Oggy.co.in and our trusted partners to gather information about you over time, across multiple websites, applications, or other platforms.
Marketing cookies help us to decide which products, services and interest-based advertisements to show you, both on and off our website and apps.
More specifically, these cookies:
•	Categorise you into a certain interest profile, for instance, on the basis of the websites you visit and your click behaviour. We use these profiles to display personalised content (such as travel ideas or specific accommodations) on Oggy.co.in and other websites.
•	Display personalised and interest-based advertisements both on the Oggy.co.in website, our apps and other websites. This is called ‘retargeting’ and is based on your browsing activities, such as the destinations you’ve been searching for, the accommodation you’ve viewed and the prices you’ve been shown. It can also be based on your shopping habits or other online activities.
Retargeting ads can be shown to you both before and after you leave Booking.com, as their purpose is to encourage you to browse or return to our website. You might see these ads on websites, in apps or in emails.
•	Integrate social media into our website and apps. This allows you to like or share content or products on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat and LinkedIn.
These ‘like’ and ‘share’ buttons work using pieces of code from the individual social media providers, allowing third party cookies to be placed on your device.
